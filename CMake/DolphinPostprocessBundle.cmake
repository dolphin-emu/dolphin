# This module can be used in two different ways.
#
# When invoked as `cmake -P DolphinPostprocessBundle.cmake`, it fixes up an
# application folder to be standalone. It bundles all required libraries from
# the system and fixes up library IDs. Any additional shared libraries, like
# plugins, that are found under Contents/MacOS/ will be made standalone as well.
#
# When called with `include(DolphinPostprocessBundle)`, it defines a helper
# function `dolphin_postprocess_bundle` that sets up the command form of the
# module as a post-build step.
