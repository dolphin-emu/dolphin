[Core]
# Values set here will override the main Dolphin settings.

[OnLoad]
# Add memory patches to be loaded once on boot here.

[OnFrame]
# Add memory patches to be applied every frame here.

[ActionReplay]
# Add action replay cheats here.

[Video_Settings]
# This game creates a large number of EFB copies at different addresses, resulting
# in a large texture cache which takes considerable time to save.
SaveTextureCacheToState = False

[Video_Hacks]
# This game crashes very soon after boot if EFB copies are scaled at higher resolutions.
# This is due to Dolphin running out of memory.  Disabling Scaled EFB copies allows playing
# at higher resolutions without the game crashing for now.
