# Work around a dcache issue by preventing the game from doing something pointless.
#
# The game's DVD read function writes 0x87654321 to the entire read buffer and 0x12345678 to the
# last 4 bytes. It then calls DVDReadAsync() and without waiting for the read to complete at all,
# it checks if the last 4 bytes are still 0x12345678. If they are, then the game fails.
#
# The check always passes on console because DVDReadAsync() -> issueCommand() calls
# DCInvalidateRange() (dcbi) on the read buffer.
#
# Dolphin cannot emulate this without an extremely significant performance hit.
