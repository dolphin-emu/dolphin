* The 1st digits sequence points areas :
* 04452D9C - Homestead
* 04452DA0 - Beach Road
* 04452DA4 - Business District
* 04452DA8 - South District
* 04452DAC - Public Square
* 04452DB0 - Church
* 04452DB4 - Mountain Road
* 04452DB8 - Lake Poli
* 04452DBC - Beach
* The second sequence points the number of runey of each type in the area (2 digits per runey type, in this order : water, rock, tree, grass. In hexa decimal : 3C = 60).
* When an area is modified, its runey amount will be locked as long as the code remains activated  (e.g. you can infinitely harvest/release runeys in a modified area, runey amount in this area won't change).

* Homestead area is not modified, it will work like vanilla : no food chain, homestead runeys will be produced by your crops. Homestead's runeys will decrease if you collect them. If homestead is in prosperity (35-35-35-35), you will gain a 1 day bonus of growth speed (fodder will regrow in 1 day instead of 2).
* Other areas will only have 1 runey at all times (even if you catch or release some in these areas).
* The purpose is to ignore the runey system as possible, but not to get penalties/bonus of other areas in return. Runeys are hardly collectible infinitely either in other aeras (locked to 1 runey).
