MP4 - Item Shop Odds Modifier:
This Gecko Code allows you to change the odds of items appearing on the MP4DX shops to your liking! It only works on the mod, do not use on the vanilla game. 
Unlike the odds code for vanilla, this one allows you to use values as large or as small as you want, no limitations and no need to calculate percentages! You're not even limited to include a minimum amount of items, if very few items are enabled, repeats will be allowed in the shop!
