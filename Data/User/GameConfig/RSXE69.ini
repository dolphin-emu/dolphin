# RSXE69 - SSX Blur
[Core] Values set here will override the main dolphin settings.
[EmuState] The Emulation State. 1 is worst, 5 is best, 0 is not set.
EmulationStateId = 3
EmulationIssues = Needs Wii nand dump (wii menu installed) to get ingame(reconnect wiimote if necessary) and LLE for proper audio. Enabling EFB cpu access will give a proper bloom effect but the game will slow down substantially. Due to the above it is a very demanding game in order to be emulated properly.
[OnFrame] Add memory patches to be applied every frame here.
[ActionReplay] Add action replay cheats here.
