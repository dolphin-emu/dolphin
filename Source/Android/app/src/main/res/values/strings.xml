    <string name="internal_resolution">Internal Resolution</string>
    <string name="internal_resolution_description">Specifies the resolution used to render at. A high resolution will improve visual quality a lot but is also quite heavy on performance and might cause glitches in certain games.</string>
    <string name="FSAA">Full-scene Anti-aliasing</string>
    <string name="FSAA_description">Reduces the amount of aliasing caused by rasterizing 3D graphics. This makes the rendered picture look less blocky. Heavily decreases emulation speed and sometimes causes issues.</string>

    <string name="scaled_efb_copy">Scaled EFB Copy</string>
    <string name="scaled_efb_copy_description">Greatly increases quality of textures generated using render to texture effects. Raising the internal resolution will improve the effect of this setting. Slightly decreases performance and possibly causes issues (although unlikely).</string>
    <string name="per_pixel_lighting">Per-Pixel Lighting</string>
    <string name="per_pixel_lighting_description">Calculate lighting of 3D graphics per-pixel rather than per vertex. Decreases emulation speed by some percent (depending on your GPU). This usually is a safe enhancement, but might cause issues sometimes.</string>
    <string name="force_texture_filtering">Force Texture Filtering</string>
    <string name="force_texture_filtering_description">Force texture filtering even if the emulated game explicitly disabled it. Improves texture quality slightly but causes glitches in some games.</string>
    <string name="force_24bit_color">Force 24-Bit Color</string>
    <string name="force_24bit_color_description">Forces the game to render the RGB color channels in 24-bit, thereby increasing quality by reducing color banding.\nIt has no impact on performance and causes few graphical issues. If unsure, leave this checked.</string>
    <string name="disable_fog">Disable Fog</string>
    <string name="disable_fog_description">Makes distant objects more visible by removing fog, thus increasing the overall detail. Disabling fog will break some games which rely on proper fog emulation.</string>
    <string name="disable_copy_filter">Disable Copy Filter</string>
    <string name="disable_copy_filter_description">Disables the blending of adjacent rows when copying the EFB. This is known in some games as \"deflickering\" or \"smoothing\". Disabling the filter is usually safe, and may result in a sharper image.</string>
    <string name="arbitrary_mipmap_detection">Arbitrary Mipmap Detection</string>
    <string name="arbitrary_mipmap_detection_description">Enables detection of arbitrary mipmaps, which some games use for special distance-based effects.\nMay have false positives that result in blurry textures at increased internal resolution, such as in games that use very low resolution mipmaps. Disabling this can also reduce stutter in games that frequently load new textures.\n\nIf unsure, leave this checked.</string>
    <string name="stereoscopy_submenu">Stereoscopy</string>
    <string name="stereoscopy_submenu_description">Stereoscopy allows you to get a better feeling of depth if you have the necessary hardware.\nHeavily decreases emulation speed and sometimes causes issues</string>
    <string name="wide_screen_hack">Widescreen Hack</string>
    <string name="wide_screen_hack_description">Forces the game to output graphics for any aspect ratio. Use with \"Aspect Ratio\" set to \"Force 16:9\" to force 4:3-only games to run at 16:9. Rarely produces good results and often partially breaks graphics and game UIs.\nUnnecessary (and detrimental) if using any AR/Gecko-code widescreen patches. If unsure, leave this unchecked.</string>
