// We can approximate the relationship between a byte offset on disc and its
// radial distance from the center by using an approximation for the length of
// a rolled material, which is the area of the material divided by the pitch
// (ie: assume that you can squish and deform the area of the disc into a
// rectangle as thick as the track pitch).
//
// In practice this yields good-enough numbers as a more exact formula
// involving the integral over a polar equation (too complex to describe here)
// or the approximation of a DVD as a set of concentric circles (which is a
// better approximation, but makes futher derivations more complicated than
// they need to be).
//
// From the area approximation, we end up with this formula:
//
// L = pi*(r.outer^2-r.inner^2)/pitch
//
// Where:
//   L = the data track's physical length
//   r.{inner,outer} = the inner/outer radii (24 mm and 58 mm)
//   pitch = the track pitch (.74 um)
//
// We can then use this equation to compute the radius for a given sector in
// the disc by mapping it along the length to a linear position and inverting
// the equation and solving for r.outer (using the DVD's r.inner and pitch)
// given that linear position:
//
// r.outer = sqrt(L * pitch / pi + r.inner^2)
//
// Where:
//   L = the offset's linear position, as offset/density
//   r.outer = the radius for the offset
//   r.inner and pitch are the same as before.
//
// The data density of the disc is just the number of bytes addressable on a
// DVD, divided by the spiral length holding that data. offset/density yields
// the linear position for a given offset.
//
// When we put it all together and simplify, we can compute the radius for a
// given byte offset as a drastically simplified:
//
// r = sqrt(offset/total_bytes*(r.outer^2-r.inner^2) + r.inner^2)
