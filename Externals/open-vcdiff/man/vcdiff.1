.SH NAME
vcdiff \- encoder/decoder for VCDIFF (RFC 3284) format
.SH DESCRIPTION
.HP
\fBvcdiff\fR  {\fBencode\fR|\fBdelta\fR|\fBdecode\fR|\fBpatch\fR}
\fB\-dictionary\fR <filename>
[<options>]
.HP
\fBencode\fR or \fBdelta\fR:
create delta file from dictionary and target file
.HP
\fBdecode\fR or \fBpatch\fR:
reconstruct target file from dictionary and delta file
.HP
\fB\-dictionary\fR <filename>
.br
File containing dictionary data (also known as source data.)
Required for all operations.
.HP
\fB\-target\fR <filename>
.br
File name of the target file (unencoded data).
The default value (blank) causes vcdiff to use standard input for encode,
or standard output for decode.
.HP
\fB\-delta\fR <filename>
.br
File name of the delta file (encoded data).
The default value (blank) causes vcdiff to use standard output for encode,
or standard input for decode.
.HP
\fB\-checksum\fR
.br
Include an Adler32 checksum of the target data when encoding.
Default is false.
.HP
\fB\-interleaved\fR
.br
Use interleaved format.  Default is false.
.HP
\fB\-stats\fR
.br
Write a report to stderr, containing the original target size,
compressed delta size, and compression percentage.
Default is false.
.HP
\fB\-target_matches\fR
.br
Find duplicate strings in target data as well as dictionary data.
Default is false.
.HP
\fB\-buffersize\fR <integer>
.br
The memory buffer size (in bytes) used for reading the input file.
Default is 1048576 (1 MB); if the input file is smaller than that,
the buffer will match the file size.  This parameter does not usually
need to be specified.
