.SH NAME
xzmore, lzmore \- view xz or lzma compressed (text) files
.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B xzmore
.RI [ file ...]
.br
.B lzmore
.RI [ file ...]
(DEPRECATED)
.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B xzmore
displays text from compressed files to a terminal using
.BR more (1).
Files supported by
.BR xz (1)
are decompressed;
other files are assumed to be in uncompressed form already.
If no
.I files
are given,
.B xzmore
reads from standard input.
See the
.BR more (1)
manual for the keyboard commands.
.PP
Note that scrolling backwards might not be possible
depending on the implementation of
.BR more (1).
This is because
.B xzmore
uses a pipe to pass the decompressed data to
.BR more (1).
.BR xzless (1)
uses
.BR less (1)
which provides more advanced features.
.PP
The command
.B lzmore
is provided for backward compatibility with LZMA Utils.
It is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
.\" TRANSLATORS: Don't translate the uppercase PAGER.
.\" It is a name of an environment variable.
.B PAGER
If
.B PAGER
is set,
its value is used as the pager instead of
.BR more (1).
