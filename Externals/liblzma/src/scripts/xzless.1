.SH DESCRIPTION
.B xzless
is a filter that displays text from compressed files to a terminal.
Files supported by
.BR xz (1)
are decompressed;
other files are assumed to be in uncompressed form already.
If no
.I files
are given,
.B xzless
reads from standard input.
.PP
.B xzless
uses
.BR less (1)
to present its output.
Unlike
.BR xzmore ,
its choice of pager cannot be altered by
setting an environment variable.
Commands are based on both
.BR more (1)
and
.BR vi (1)
and allow back and forth movement and searching.
See the
.BR less (1)
manual for more information.

The command named
