	//     without providing any new input. This would then result in
	//     LZMA_BUF_ERROR even though more output would be available
	//     once the worker threads decode more data.
	//
	// (2) Even if (1) is true, we will not wait if the previous call to
	//     this function managed to produce some output and the output
	//     buffer became full. This is for compatibility with applications
	//     that call lzma_code() in such a way that new input is provided
	//     only when the output buffer didn't become full. Without this
	//     trick such applications would have bad performance (bad
	//     parallelization due to decoder not getting input fast enough).

	// wait (timeout can still cause us to return) because we know that
	// we won't get any more input. This matters if the input file is
	// truncated and we are doing single-shot decoding, that is,
	// timeout = 0 and LZMA_FINISH is used on the first call to

	//     truncated input. The rest would be available if lzma_code() was
	//     called again but then it's not single-shot decoding anymore.
	//
	//   - By handling LZMA_FINISH specially here, the first call will
	//     produce all the output, matching the behavior of the
	//     single-threaded decoder.
