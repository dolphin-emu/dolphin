.SH NAME
xzdec, lzmadec \- Small .xz and .lzma decompressors
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B xzdec
.RI [ option... ]
.RI [ file... ]
.br
.B lzmadec
.RI [ option... ]
.RI [ file... ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B xzdec
is a liblzma-based decompression-only tool for
.B .xz
(and only
.BR .xz )
files.
.B xzdec
is intended to work as a drop-in replacement for
.BR xz (1)
in the most common situations where a script
has been written to use
.B "xz \-\-decompress \-\-stdout"
(and possibly a few other commonly used options) to decompress
.B .xz
files.
.B lzmadec
is identical to
.B xzdec
except that
.B lzmadec
supports
.B .lzma
files instead of
.B .xz
files.
.PP
To reduce the size of the executable,
.B xzdec
doesn't support multithreading or localization,
and doesn't read options from
.B XZ_DEFAULTS
and
.B XZ_OPT
environment variables.
.B xzdec
doesn't support displaying intermediate progress information: sending
.B SIGINFO
to
.B xzdec
does nothing, but sending
.B SIGUSR1
terminates the process instead of displaying progress information.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR \-d ", " \-\-decompress ", " \-\-uncompress
Ignored for
.BR xz (1)
compatibility.
.B xzdec
supports only decompression.
.TP
.BR \-k ", " \-\-keep
Ignored for
.BR xz (1)
compatibility.
.B xzdec
never creates or removes any files.
.TP
.BR \-c ", " \-\-stdout ", " \-\-to-stdout
Ignored for
.BR xz (1)
compatibility.
.B xzdec
always writes the decompressed data to standard output.
.TP
.BR \-q ", " \-\-quiet
Specifying this once does nothing since
.B xzdec
never displays any warnings or notices.
Specify this twice to suppress errors.
.TP
.BR \-Q ", " \-\-no-warn
Ignored for
.BR xz (1)
compatibility.
.B xzdec
never uses the exit status 2.
.TP
.BR \-h ", " \-\-help
Display a help message and exit successfully.
.TP
.BR \-V ", " \-\-version
Display the version number of
.B xzdec
and liblzma.
.SH "EXIT STATUS"
.TP
.B 0
All was good.
.TP
.B 1
An error occurred.
.PP
.B xzdec
doesn't have any warning messages like
.BR xz (1)
has, thus the exit status 2 is not used by
.BR xzdec .
.SH NOTES
Use
.BR xz (1)
instead of
.B xzdec
or
.B lzmadec
for normal everyday use.
.B xzdec
or
.B lzmadec
are meant only for situations where it is important to have
a smaller decompressor than the full-featured
.BR xz (1).
.PP
.B xzdec
and
.B lzmadec
are not really that small.
The size can be reduced further by dropping
features from liblzma at compile time,
but that shouldn't usually be done for executables distributed
in typical non-embedded operating system distributions.
If you need a truly small
.B .xz
decompressor, consider using XZ Embedded.
