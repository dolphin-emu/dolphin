Authors of XZ Utils
===================

    XZ Utils is developed and maintained by
    Lasse Collin <lasse.collin@tukaani.org>.

    Major parts of liblzma are based on code written by Igor Pavlov,
    specifically the LZMA SDK <https://7-zip.org/sdk.html>. Without
    this code, XZ Utils wouldn't exist.

    The SHA-256 implementation in liblzma is based on code written by
    Wei Dai in Crypto++ Library <https://www.cryptopp.com/>.

    A few scripts have been adapted from GNU gzip. The original
    versions were written by Jean-loup Gailly, Charles Levert, and
    Paul Eggert. Andrew Dudman helped adapting the scripts and their
    man pages for XZ Utils.

    The initial version of the threaded .xz decompressor was written
    by Sebastian Andrzej Siewior.

    The initial version of the .lz (lzip) decoder was written
    by Michał Górny.

    Architecture-specific CRC optimizations were contributed by
    Ilya Kurdyukov, Chenxi Mao, and Xi Ruoyao.

    Other authors:
      - Jonathan Nieder
      - Joachim Henke

    Special author: Jia Tan was a co-maintainer in 2022-2024. He and
    the team behind him inserted a backdoor (CVE-2024-3094) into
    XZ Utils 5.6.0 and 5.6.1 releases. He suddenly disappeared when
    this was discovered.

    Many people have contributed improvements or reported bugs.
    Most of these people are mentioned in the file THANKS.

    The translations of the command line tools and man pages have been
    contributed by many people via the Translation Project:

      - https://translationproject.org/domain/xz.html
      - https://translationproject.org/domain/xz-man.html

    The authors of the translated man pages are in the header comments
    of the man page files. In the source package, the authors of the
    translations are in po/*.po and po4a/*.po files.

    Third-party code whose authors aren't listed here:

      - GNU getopt_long() in the 'lib' directory is included for
        platforms that don't have a usable getopt_long().

      - The build system files from GNU Autoconf, GNU Automake,
        GNU Libtool, GNU Gettext, Autoconf Archive, and related files.
