Contribution Guidelines
=======================

You would like to see a feature implemented or a bug fixed in SFML? Great!
Contributions to SFML are highly appreciated, be it in the form of general
ideas, concrete suggestions or code patches.

A few guiding rules have been set up on the SFML website that you should be
aware of before opening an Issue or Pull Request. They will help you focus
on the important stuff and prevent you from losing (y)our time with requests
that are out of SFML's scope, known issues, and so on.

                http://www.sfml-dev.org/contribute.php

Those rules cover the general scope defined for this project, a coding
style, and a precise procedure to report bugs or suggest new features.
