     encryption and private key for decryption. (Closes ticket #34)

     management (Closes ticket #44)
   * Changed the used random function pointer to more flexible format. Renamed
     havege_rand() to havege_random() to prevent mistakes. Lots of changes as
     a consequence in library code and programs
   * Moved all examples programs to use the new entropy and CTR_DRBG
   * Added permissive certificate parsing to x509parse_crt() and
     x509parse_crtfile(). With permissive parsing the parsing does not stop on
     encountering a parse-error. Beware that the meaning of return values has
     changed!
   * All error codes are now negative. Even on mermory failures and IO errors.

Bugfix
   * Fixed faulty HMAC-MD2 implementation. Found by dibac. (Closes
     ticket #37)
   * Fixed a bug where the CRL parser expected an EXPLICIT ASN.1 tag
     before version numbers
   * Allowed X509 key usage parsing to accept 4 byte values instead of the
     standard 1 byte version sometimes used by Microsoft. (Closes ticket #38)
   * Fixed incorrect behaviour in case of RSASSA-PSS with a salt length
     smaller than the hash length. (Closes ticket #41)

     appended with '....' after first 28 octets
   * Improved build support for s390x and sparc64 in bignum.h

   * Corrected removal of leading "00:" in printing serial numbers in
     certificates and CRLs

     codes instead of integers

     #18)

= Version 0.99-pre5 released on 2011-05-26
Features
   * Added additional Cipher Block Modes to symmetric ciphers
     (AES CTR, Camellia CTR, XTEA CBC) including the option to
     enable and disable individual modes when needed
   * Functions requiring File System functions can now be disabled
     by undefining POLARSSL_FS_IO
   * A error_strerror function() has been added to translate between
     error codes and their description.
   * Added mpi_get_bit() and mpi_set_bit() individual bit setter/getter
     functions.
   * Added ssl_mail_client and ssl_fork_server as example programs.

Changes
   * Major argument / variable rewrite. Introduced use of size_t
     instead of int for buffer lengths and loop variables for
     better unsigned / signed use. Renamed internal bigint types
     t_int and t_dbl to t_uint and t_udbl in the process
   * mpi_init() and mpi_free() now only accept a single MPI
     argument and do not accept variable argument lists anymore.
   * The error codes have been remapped and combining error codes
     is now done with a PLUS instead of an OR as error codes
     used are negative.
   * Changed behaviour of net_read(), ssl_fetch_input() and ssl_recv().
     net_recv() now returns 0 on EOF instead of
     POLARSSL_ERR_NET_CONN_RESET. ssl_fetch_input() returns
     POLARSSL_ERR_SSL_CONN_EOF on an EOF from its f_recv() function.
     ssl_read() returns 0 if a POLARSSL_ERR_SSL_CONN_EOF is received
     after the handshake.
   * Network functions now return POLARSSL_ERR_NET_WANT_READ or
     POLARSSL_ERR_NET_WANT_WRITE instead of the ambiguous
     POLARSSL_ERR_NET_TRY_AGAIN

= Version 0.99-pre4 released on 2011-04-01
Features
   * Added support for PKCS#1 v2.1 encoding and thus support
     for the RSAES-OAEP and RSASSA-PSS operations.
   * Reading of Public Key files incorporated into default x509
     functionality as well.
   * Added mpi_fill_random() for centralized filling of big numbers
     with random data (Fixed ticket #10)

Changes
   * Debug print of MPI now removes leading zero octets and 
     displays actual bit size of the value.
   * x509parse_key() (and as a consequence x509parse_keyfile()) 
     does not zeroize memory in advance anymore. Use rsa_init()
     before parsing a key or keyfile!

Bugfix
   * Debug output of MPI's now the same independent of underlying
     platform (32-bit / 64-bit) (Fixes ticket #19, found by Mads
     Kiilerich and Mihai Militaru)
   * Fixed bug in ssl_write() when flushing old data (Fixed ticket
     #18, found by Nikolay Epifanov)

     length salt lengths

     printing of X509 CRLs from file

     systems only using DER encoding

     after 1950

     certificates (found by Mads Kiilerich)

     found by Boris Krasnovskiy)

     Diffie Hellman key exchange (thanks to Larry Highsmith,
     Subreption LLC)

Changes

     the existing date check
   * The ciphers member of ssl_context and the cipher member
     of ssl_session have been renamed to ciphersuites and

     with the generic cipher layer and is better naming
     altogether

================================================================
XySSL ChangeLog

= Version 0.9 released on 2008-03-16

    * Added support for ciphersuite: SSL_RSA_AES_128_SHA
    * Enabled support for large files by default in aescrypt2.c
    * Preliminary openssl wrapper contributed by David Barrett
    * Fixed a bug in ssl_write() that caused the same payload to
      be sent twice in non-blocking mode when send returns EAGAIN
    * Fixed ssl_parse_client_hello(): session id and challenge must
      not be swapped in the SSLv2 ClientHello (found by Greg Robson)
    * Added user-defined callback debug function (Krystian Kolodziej)
    * Before freeing a certificate, properly zero out all cert. data
    * Fixed the "mode" parameter so that encryption/decryption are
      not swapped on PadLock; also fixed compilation on older versions
      of gcc (bug reported by David Barrett)
    * Correctly handle the case in padlock_xcryptcbc() when input or
      ouput data is non-aligned by falling back to the software
      implementation, as VIA Nehemiah cannot handle non-aligned buffers
    * Fixed a memory leak in x509parse_crt() which was reported by Greg
      Robson-Garth; some x509write.c fixes by Pascal Vizeli, thanks to
      Matthew Page who reported several bugs
    * Fixed x509_get_ext() to accept some rare certificates which have
      an INTEGER instead of a BOOLEAN for BasicConstraints::cA.
    * Added support on the client side for the TLS "hostname" extension
      (patch contributed by David Patino)
    * Make x509parse_verify() return BADCERT_CN_MISMATCH when an empty
      string is passed as the CN (bug reported by spoofy)
    * Added an option to enable/disable the BN assembly code
    * Updated rsa_check_privkey() to verify that (D*E) = 1 % (P-1)*(Q-1)
    * Disabled obsolete hash functions by default (MD2, MD4); updated
      selftest and benchmark to not test ciphers that have been disabled
    * Updated x509parse_cert_info() to correctly display byte 0 of the
      serial number, setup correct server port in the ssl client example
    * Fixed a critical denial-of-service with X.509 cert. verification:
      peer may cause xyssl to loop indefinitely by sending a certificate
      for which the RSA signature check fails (bug reported by Benoit)
    * Added test vectors for: AES-CBC, AES-CFB, DES-CBC and 3DES-CBC,
      HMAC-MD5, HMAC-SHA1, HMAC-SHA-256, HMAC-SHA-384, and HMAC-SHA-512
    * Fixed HMAC-SHA-384 and HMAC-SHA-512 (thanks to Josh Sinykin)
    * Modified ssl_parse_client_key_exchange() to protect against
      Daniel Bleichenbacher attack on PKCS#1 v1.5 padding, as well
      as the Klima-Pokorny-Rosa extension of Bleichenbacher's attack
    * Updated rsa_gen_key() so that ctx->N is always nbits in size
    * Fixed assembly PPC compilation errors on Mac OS X, thanks to
      David Barrett and Dusan Semen

= Version 0.8 released on 2007-10-20

    * Modified the HMAC functions to handle keys larger
      than 64 bytes, thanks to Stephane Desneux and gary ng

      message digests, which fixes IE6/IE7 client authentication
    * Cleaned up the XYSSL* #defines, suggested by Azriel Fasten
    * Fixed net_recv(), thanks to Lorenz Schori and Egon Kocjan
    * Added user-defined callbacks for handling I/O and sessions
    * Added lots of debugging output in the SSL/TLS functions
    * Added preliminary X.509 cert. writing by Pascal Vizeli
    * Added preliminary support for the VIA PadLock routines
    * Added AES-CFB mode of operation, contributed by chmike
    * Added an SSL/TLS stress testing program (ssl_test.c)
    * Updated the RSA PKCS#1 code to allow choosing between
      RSA_PUBLIC and RSA_PRIVATE, as suggested by David Barrett
    * Updated ssl_read() to skip 0-length records from OpenSSL
    * Fixed the make install target to comply with *BSD make
    * Fixed a bug in mpi_read_binary() on 64-bit platforms
    * mpi_is_prime() speedups, thanks to Kevin McLaughlin
    * Fixed a long standing memory leak in mpi_is_prime()
    * Replaced realloc with malloc in mpi_grow(), and set
      the sign of zero as positive in mpi_init() (reported
      by Jonathan M. McCune)

      dh_client, dh_server, rsa_genkey, rsa_sign, rsa_verify
    * Added new bignum import and export helper functions
    * Rewrote README.txt in program/ssl/ca to better explain
      how to create a test PKI
