libusb
======

libusb is a library for USB device access from Linux, Mac OS X,
Windows, OpenBSD/NetBSD and Haiku userspace.
It is written in C (Haiku backend in C++) and licensed under the GNU
Lesser General Public License version 2.1 or, at your option, any later
version (see COPYING).

libusb is abstracted internally in such a way that it can hopefully
be ported to other operating systems. Please see the PORTING file
for more information.
